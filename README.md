# Style Dictionary example

This example code is bare-bones to show you what this framework can do when working with the Unlocked design tokens. 

We have stripped it down to just export the necessary JS files you'll need according to our design tokens.

Please take a look at the style dictionary documentation as this is a barebones example project and intended to demonstrate only what can be done.

For further references feel free to look at the [Unlocked documentation](https://docs.unlocked.to/compositions/getting-started.html).

## Install

```console 
git clone https://github.com/UnlockedUI/style-dictionary-example.git
```

## Instructions

Export your Unlocked design tokens from your Figma file and replace the input file.

```console
npm run build
```
